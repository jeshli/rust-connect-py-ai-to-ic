# rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic

Seamlessly Bridge Python AI Models with the Internet Computer.

## Overview

"Python (design and train), Rust (upload), IC (run)" - this succinct mantra captures the essence of `rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic`. Our toolkit is an open-source solution designed to enable AI researchers and developers to effortlessly upload and deploy Python-based machine learning models for inference on the Internet Computer (IC) platform.

Focused on ease of use and versatility, `rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic` aims to streamline the integration of advanced AI capabilities into the decentralized environment of the IC. This project represents a pivotal step towards harnessing the power of the IC for AI, with potential future expansions into model training and user-friendly drag-and-drop functionalities.

## Features

- **Effortless Upload**: Simplify the process of uploading Python-based AI models to the IC using Rust.
- **Inference on IC**: Run your machine learning models on a decentralized platform, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Internet Computer.
- **Future Expansion**: Potential for extending the toolkit to include model training and easy-to-use drag-and-drop features.
